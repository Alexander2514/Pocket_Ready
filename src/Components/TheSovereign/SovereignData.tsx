    title: "The Burden of Responsibility",
    desc: "True preparedness isn't about paranoia; it's about the weight of being the man who can act when others can't. In a world that prizes comfort, the modern operator chooses the discomfort of training. Whether it's medical proficiency or mechanical aptitude, being ready is a commitment to the safety of those who rely on you.",

    title: "Multidisciplinary Mastery",
    desc: "A man is more than his primary trade. We advocate for the 'Generalist'—the individual who understands navigation, basic trauma care, and the physics of his environment. Gear is a force multiplier, but your mind is the engine. Sovereignty comes from knowing how to navigate the world without a digital crutch.",

    title: "The Preparedness Movement",
    desc: "Our movement is built on the philosophy that a complete man is a protector by nature. We cultivate the skills and the curated intelligence required to stay ahead of chaos. It is the synergy between professional hardware and the discipline of a student. We don't just carry tools; we carry the legacy of self-reliance.",

  {
    title: "Tactical Integrity",
    desc: "Integrity is the discipline of choosing what works over what impresses. Every tool, method, and principle we stand behind is evaluated through real-world application—not trends or aesthetics. True readiness is quiet, intentional, and repeatable. PocketReady represents a standard: carry less, know more, and rely only on what has earned its place.",

  {
  title: "The Silent Professional",
  desc: "Sovereignty is not loud. It is the quiet confidence of the man who is prepared for the worst but works for the best. We foster a mindset where ego is secondary to utility, and where the goal is to be an asset to your community in times of crisis, not a liability.",

},
{
  title: "Legacy of Self-Reliance",
  desc: "We are reclaiming the skills of our ancestors—those who built, fixed, and defended with their own hands. Modern convenience has made us fragile; multidisciplinary mastery makes us anti-fragile. To be PocketReady is to carry the tools and the grit to remain standing when the grid fails.",
